I am Research Scientist at the Future Interaction group in <a href="https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge">Samsung's AI Center - Cambridge</a> since 2024. Earlier, I completed my PhD at Queen Mary University of London in the MMV Group, supervised by [Prof. Ioannis Patras](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ioannisp/) and [Prof. Georgios Tzimiropoulos](https://ytzimiro.github.io/). My research interests revolve around representation learning for vision & language models.
