I am a 3rd year PhD student at Queen Mary University of London in the MMV Group, supervised by [Prof. Ioannis Patras](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ioannisp/) and [Prof. Georgios Tzimiropoulos](https://ytzimiro.github.io/). My research interests revolve around unsupervised representation learning, specifically on the subjects deep clustering and representation learning for dense prediction tasks. For more on what our research group is working on, please see [our publications](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ioannisp/publications/).
